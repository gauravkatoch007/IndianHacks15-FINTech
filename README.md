Generally, when we go out to buy in a market, we have to carry a trolley and keep on adding the items we like in our trolley and carry it around. In a crowded supermarket during peak times, it becomes a hassle to carry around a trolley from one end to another to complete your weekly shopping. Also, at the checkout, cashier then checks each and every item and prepares the bill. This process mostly ends up in large queues in crowded supermarket.  Can we leverage technology to streamline this process for a better User experience -- YES

#Idea - 
Customers don’t carry trolleys to collect their inventories, they rather go around with their mobile phones, scan bar-code of items with the app which gives them relevant details about the item, they can select the quantity they want in the app.
Customers keep checking items physically in the supermarket, scanning them with their mobile app, and the desired cart in their app. Meanwhile, customer executives will get the relevant details and can start preparing the relevant carts (physically) for the customers in back office. (Could be automated by robotic arms as well)
When customer is done preparing desired inventory, he selects checkout from the app. On selecting checkout, customer would get the allotted booth to collect his packaged inventory from. Customer can decide to choose either Cash on delivery at booth or pay online from the app. 

a. This process will reduce queue at checkout, as the bags will come packed from back office (warehouse) with bills, so they don’t have to rescan each item at checkout queue.

b. People get to shop faster, as they don’t have to carry around trolleys.
