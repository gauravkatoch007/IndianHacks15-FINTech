Generally, when we go out to buy in a market, we have to carry a trolley and keep on adding the items we like in our trolley and carry it around. In a crowded supermarket during peak times, it becomes a hassle to carry around a trolley from one end to another to complete your weekly shopping. Also, at the checkout, cashier then checks each and every item and prepares the bill. This process mostly ends up in large queues in crowded supermarket.  Can we leverage technology to streamline this process for a better User experience -- YES
